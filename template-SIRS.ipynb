    "Models have $n$ parameters and $m$ variables in initial vectors. Combined they form $n+m$-dimentional area where we search a solution for IV problem that approximates known cases best. To find the optimal solution we use _Non-linear Least Squares_ method from `scipy.optimize` package (see [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.least_squares.html)).\n",
